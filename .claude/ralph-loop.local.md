Iterate on the DraftCast auction app design for mobile-first 2025-2026 best practices. Focus on: 1) Modern glass morphism and gradients, 2) Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px), 3) Smooth micro-animations, 4) Better typography hierarchy, 5) Improved card layouts for small screens, 6) Bottom navigation patterns, 7) Pull-to-refresh feel, 8) Dark mode optimization, 9) Reduce visual clutter, 10) Modern spacing and rounded corners. Review and improve these files: app/lrccsuper11/page.tsx, components/AuctionStatus.tsx, components/TeamCard.tsx, app/globals.css. Make incremental improvements each iteration. Run npm run build to verify.
